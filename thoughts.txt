Name:Monster Assistant
Desc: Hand Activated Switch is unreachable, able to use monster to reach it.
Ex: Fighting a Warhog, switch is on a tall platform towards the end of the room.  If one attempts to jump ontop of the Warhog, Warhog does an upward attack deflection and upon landing pushes back.  Fights normally otherwise.  Once HP is lowered about halfway, it may initiate a charge attack where it lowers its head to charge forward.  Jump over it during the charge, it will hit the wall and be stunned against the wall.  Jump up its back and use it to jump onto the platform to activate the switch.

Name: Location Race
Desc: Upon entering room, object slowly rolls towards the end door, once reaching it; it will close the end door, forcing a restart of the room.  Must reach end door before objects reaches first.
Ex: Enter a room, floor filled with oil.  hit switch to open end door, but breaks open a path along the top of the room where a rock of fire slowly rolls to a hole.

Name: King of the Hill
Desc: Player must stand on a large button that slowly decends.  Once decended all the way, the end door will stay open.  Opponents will attempt to keep player off.
